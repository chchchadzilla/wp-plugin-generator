Generate a production-ready WordPress plugin based on the following request:

{{spec}}

Requirements:
- Return only valid PHP plugin code that can live in a single main plugin file.
- Include a standard plugin header comment with name, description, version, and author fields.
- Add thoughtful inline comments explaining key logic blocks.
- Avoid external dependencies; rely on WordPress core APIs.
- Provide safe defaults and nonce/permission checks around any actions or filters you register.
